  ItemName: Wooden Sitting Device
  ItemDescription: HOLY CRAP! This is a wooden sitting device. It includes many things
    useful for sitting, such as 4 legs and a back. I sure hope the description isn't
    droning on for too long....

    PossibleDescriptions:
    - This wooden sitting device broke the first time I sat on it. The seller should
      be banned or somebody will get hurt
    - This wooden sitting device instantly broke when I put weight on it. However,
      for those few seconds, it was very comfy.
    - I weigh 7 pounds and this wooden sitting device still broke. How is that even
      possible?
