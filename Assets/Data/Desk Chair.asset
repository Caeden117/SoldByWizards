    PossibleDescriptions:
    - This sitting device broke the first time I sat on it. The seller should be
      banned or somebody will get hurt
    - This sitting device instantly broke when I put weight on it. However, for those
      few seconds, it was very comfy.
    - I weigh 7 pounds and this sitting device still broke. How is that even possible?
