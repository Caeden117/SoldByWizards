    PossibleDescriptions:
    - Got this in the mail and it literally does not work. This is the single worst
      seller I've ever had the displeasure of dealing with.
    - Got this in the mail and it literally does not work. It looks like it was smashed
      by a sledgehammer.

    - Misleading
    - I feel mislead
    - Misleading info
    PossibleDescriptions:
    - The listing said this was a 55" 4K LCD, but I received a TV so old it was still
      in black and white.
    - I was told I was buying a 4K TV, but this TV doesn't even have half a K. Why
      is this seller allowed on illuzion?
    - I thought this was a new flatscreen TV, but some random tiny AbracadabriExpress
      junk showed up on my doorstep. STAY AWAY!

    PossibleTitles:
    - Weird TV
    - Strange object?
    - TV weirdly tuned
    PossibleDescriptions:
    - The TV is pretty solid, but it only plays shows from Dimension 55B. Although,
      all things considered, those shows are better than what I would have watched
      anyways.
    - The TV is good, but it only plays crime movies. Specifically about stealing
      things and reselling them for profit. Not sure what's up with that.
