    PossibleDescriptions:
    - This lounging device broke the first time I sat on it. The seller should be
      banned or somebody will get hurt
    - This lounging device instantly broke when I put weight on it. However, for
      those few seconds, it was very comfy.
    - I weigh 7 pounds and this lounging device still broke. How is that even possible?
